# ToDoList
To-Do List Web App  A simple and interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project is part of my MERN development journey, created specifically to practice and master JavaScript after gaining confidence with HTML and CSS.

🚀 Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts, including:

DOM selection & manipulation

Event handling

Working with forms

Rendering dynamic UI

Using array methods (push, find, splice, forEach)

Template strings

Conditional logic

User feedback using messages

This project helps build the foundation required before moving deeper into React, Node.js, and full MERN development.

✨ Features

✔ Add new tasks
✔ Prevent adding duplicate tasks
✔ Mark tasks as completed (line-through effect)
✔ Delete tasks with confirmation
✔ Real-time success/error notifications
✔ Fully dynamic list rendering
✔ Clean UI with simple CSS

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Functionality & DOM manipulation

No libraries, frameworks, or backend — focusing entirely on mastering pure JavaScript logic.

🔮 Future Improvements

Add LocalStorage so tasks stay after page refresh

Add Edit Task option

Add Dark/Light mode toggle

Add animations for task addition and removal

Convert to a React-based To-Do app later in the MERN journey

📚 Learning Outcome

This project significantly improved my ability to:

Think in JavaScript

Structure real-world logic

Work with the DOM efficiently

Build interactive components without frameworks

A solid step toward becoming a professional MERN Stack Developer.
